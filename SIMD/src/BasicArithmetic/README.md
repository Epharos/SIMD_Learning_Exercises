# Basic Arithmetic

## Overview

This exercise was part of my SIMD learning process. The goal was to implement basic arithmetic operations using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions. The exercise was designed to help me understand how to leverage SIMD for performance improvements in numerical computations.

### Goals

- Implement basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using SIMD instructions.
- Profile the performance of SIMD implementations compared to scalar implementations.

## Solution

In order to better understand the SIMD instructions, I implemented the basic arithmetic operations using both scalar and SIMD approaches. The SIMD implementations were done using Intel's SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) intrinsics and AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions) intrinsics.
